# Community Platform Core (Frontend + Backend)

## What this is
A production-ready **community platform core** with authentication, user profiles, feeds, and user‑generated content.

This project is designed to represent the **type of systems most SaaS products, internal tools, and member platforms need** — not a consumer social network.

---

## Who this is for
- SaaS founders
- Indie hackers
- Teams building member platforms
- Companies needing internal community tools

If you need **auth, users, feeds, and content**, this is the foundation.

---

## What I do
I build, fix, and **maintain systems like this**:
- Authentication & authorization
- APIs & backend logic
- User profiles & feeds
- Dashboards & internal tools
- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes

I work async and offer **small monthly retainers**.

---

## Features (public-facing)
- Secure authentication (access & refresh tokens)
- User profiles & relationships
- Role‑based access
- User‑generated content
- Feed logic (personalized & discovery)
- Admin‑level visibility

> Additional modules exist in the codebase but are intentionally not positioned as core features.

## Demo
**Live demo:** _add link_

**Test credentials:**
- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: password123

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js
- React
- Modern component & state structure

### Backend
- Go (clean layered architecture)
- REST APIs
- JWT authentication
- PostgreSQL
- Database migrations

---

## Repository Structure

```
/frontend   → Next.js application
/backend    → Go API service
```

Each part can be run independently or together in production.

---

## How this is used in practice
This codebase represents the **exact class of systems** I work on for clients:
- maintaining existing applications
- shipping missing features
- fixing bugs in production
- improving backend performance

The goal is **stability and reliability**, not feature bloat.
